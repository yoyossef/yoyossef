### Hey 👋🏽

I am Yossef, a software engineer and CompSci master's student at the University of Strasbourg. I recently worked as an SWE Apprentice on the Rainbow Web team at [Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise](https://www.al-enterprise.com/), helping build new experiences for a business communication platform using `Angular`, `WebRTC` and the `XMPP` protocol.

On the side, I am working on projects like a Pro Clubs Discord Bot and making other contributions related to gaming on linux.

I am looking for SWE positions for Sep. 2021 across Europe.

🌱  &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m currently learning: Hadoop, PySpark and reinforcing my C skills

📚  &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm currently reading: Extreme C, Linux Device Drivers Third Edition

👯  &nbsp;&nbsp;I’m looking to collaborate on Linux stuff 🐧 :)
